## What is the difference between Machine Learning and AI?

The field of Artificial Intelligence has been around since the 1950s (ref: Dartmouth Conference). It is a broad topic which encompasses a number of sub-fields including but not limited to: Logic, Probability, Knowledge Representation, and Machine Learning.

Figure 1 shows how a system based on Artificial Intelligence might function:

``` mermaid
graph LR
A -> B;
B --> C;
C --> A;
```

The history of Logic stretches all the way back to Aristotle in the Organon and was formalised by George Boole in the 19th century (hence the name Boolean Logic). With logic we can write rules to reason about data or make decisions. “If it rains I will carry an umbrella”.
Logical rules are based on things being True or False but the world is not so clear cut. Probability lets us add doubt and uncertainty: “It might rain today, should I take an umbrella?”.
With logical rules and probability we can solve quite complex tasks, but there are limits: “Which paintings in our collection have umbrellas in them?”.
